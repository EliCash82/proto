What is Proto?
Proto is the working title of this thesis with a Digital Humanities concentration.  The attempt is to write a Python code that shares established canonical interface with egodic texts from the 1980s.  

Purpose
To template a very simple example of a Python based DH project in a form that can be malleable (i.o.w. forked), useful, and engaging.  What is the result of transforming a literary text from the 19th Century into something interactive?  Can such a project cement pedagogy from within its structure?

Possible texts:
Caleb Williams
Pros: First Adventure Novel, Familiar with the text
Cons: Not sci fi which might be more in tune with the ergodic theme

VRIL - The Coming Race
Pros: Interesting proto sci-fi story
Cons: Charged revision in present day [could work as a pro, but could be a strong con]

The Machine Stops
Pros: Good proto sci-fi narrative, could be made ludic
Cons: Less familiar with text, too short and minimal for longer supplemental research paper.

MORE: Still ruminating on text choices, doing some reading through research specifically about 19th century literary scene and rules of proto-science fiction

Thinking about maybe even Twain... curious about researching into what influenced his time travel and trip to space narratives... even The Mysterious Stranger has a really modern sci-fi bend to it, very familiar with multiple manuscripts of said text.
