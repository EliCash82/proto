What is Proto?
Proto is the working title of this thesis with a Digital Humanities concentration.  The attempt is to write a Python code that shares established canonical interface with egodic texts from the 1980s.  

Purpose
To template a very simple example of a Python based DH project in a form that can be malleable (i.o.w. forked), useful, and engaging.  What is the result of transforming a literary text from the 19th Century into something interactive?  Can such a project cement pedagogy from within its structure?

Possible texts:
Caleb Williams
Pros: First Adventure Novel, Familiar with the text
Cons: Not sci fi which might be more in tune with the ergodic theme

VRIL - The Coming Race
Pros: Interesting proto sci-fi story
Cons: Charged revision in present day [could work as a pro, but could be a strong con]

The Machine Stops
Pros: Good proto sci-fi narrative, could be made ludic
Cons: Less familiar with text, too short and minimal for longer supplemental research paper.

MORE: Still ruminating on text choices, doing some reading through research specifically about 19th century literary scene and rules of proto-science fiction

Thinking about maybe even Twain... curious about researching into what influenced his time travel and trip to space narratives... even The Mysterious Stranger has a really modern sci-fi bend to it, very familiar with multiple manuscripts of said text.

Things I want in "text adventure":
Combat Engine: A way for battles to take place within the narrative, and experience points gained, and maybe two or three skills. [infinite escape skill] [fighting++] [magic]

Library: I think it would be interesting if I embedded pieces of information that required the user to go through an entire text (i.e., program an 1800s Bible, alchemical text, newspaper, penny dreadful, etc)

Thinking more and more about using Caleb Williams.  It just seems like it would translate better, in that book there are definitive protagonist running from antagonist/henchmen.  It is just a narrative that seems like it could be part of an engaging ergodic text.  Without a combat system I am finding it hard to think of a way to keep present day audiences engaged.

MUD? I think a MUD could be fun, since that would allow multiple users able to play, but it seems that that would be a more difficult endeavour.  What I want to do is research how I could best program this while making a transition to MUD engine less time consuming in the long run.
